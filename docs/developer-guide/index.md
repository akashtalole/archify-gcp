# Developer guide

For people who want to change archify-gcp: add a service, a cost model, a review rule, a group kind or an exporter.

## Design constraints

* **No npm dependencies.** Node ≥ 20 built-ins only (ZIP reading, price-file scanning, XML generation, even the headless-Chrome helpers are hand-written). Python is used only to build this documentation.
* **Deterministic.** Same input and data → byte-identical output. No timestamps in receipts, stable ordering everywhere.
* **Fail loudly.** Ambiguity (two price SKUs, an unknown icon, an unroutable edge) is an error or a flagged status, never a silent guess.
* **Data is committed, tools are not data-dependent at runtime.** Icons are fetched; the price book, Well-Architected corpus and draw.io shape table are committed snapshots with scripts to refresh them.

## Setup for development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akashtalole/archify-gcp && cd archify-gcp
npm run icons:fetch
npm test
```

Documentation:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-docs.txt
node scripts/stage-docs.mjs     # copies example pages into docs/live/
mkdocs serve                    # http://127.0.0.1:8000
```
