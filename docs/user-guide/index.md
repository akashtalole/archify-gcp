## The workflow in one picture

```text
spec.json ──validate──▶ layout + routing ──▶ SVG ──┬──▶ HTML page  (Diagram · Cost · Well-Architected)
                                                   ├──▶ PNG
                                                   ├──▶ draw.io
                                                   └──▶ receipt.json

```

`finalize` runs the whole chain and refuses to succeed if any gate fails. See [Quality gates](finalize.md).
